4. (15 points)

Two small speakers S are positioned a distance of 0.75 m from each other, as shown in the diagram above. The
â€˜two speakers are each emitting a constant 2500 Hz tone, and the sound waves from the speakers are in phase
with each other. A student is standing at point P, which is a distance of 5.0 m from the midpoint between the
speakers, and hears a maximum as expected. Assume that reflections from nearby objects are negligible. Use
343 m/s for the speed of sound.
