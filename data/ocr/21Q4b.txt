‘The cylinder is again placed at the top of the incline. A block, also of mass mo, is placed at the top of a
separate rough incline of length Lg and height Hp, as shown above. When the cylinder and block are released
at the same instant, the cylinder begins to roll without slipping while the block begins to accelerate uniformly.
‘The cylinder and the block reach the bottoms of their respective inclines with the same translational speed.

(b) In terms of energy, explain why the two objects reach the bottom of their respective inclines with the same
translational speed. Provide your answer in a clear, coherent paragraph-length response that may also contain
figures and/or equations.
