(Â©) The index of refraction of this glass is 1,66 for violet light, which has wavelength 425 nm in air,
i. Given the same incident angle @,, show on the ray diagram on the previous page how the refracted ray
for the violet light would vary from the refracted ray already drawn for the red light.

ii, Sketch the graph of sin @, versus sin 8, for the violet light on the figure on the previous page that
shows the same graph already drawn for the red light.
