‘Team 1 ‘Team 2

4. (7 points, suggested time 13 minutes)

‘A physics class is asked to design a low-friction slide that will launch a block horizontally from the top of a
lab table. Teams 1 and 2 assemble the slides shown above and use identical blocks I and 2, respectively. Both
slides start at the same height d above the tabletop. However, team 2's table is lower than team I’s table. To
‘compensate for the lower table, team 2.constructs the right end of the slide to rise above the tabletop so that the
block leaves the slide horizontally at the same height / above the floor as does team 1's block (see figure above).
