A cylinder is fitted with a freely moveable piston of area 1.20 x 10°? m? and negligible mass. The cylinder
below the piston is filled with a gas. At state 1, the gas has volume 1.50 x 107m, pressure 1.02 x 10° Pa, and

the cylinder is in contact with a water bath at a temperature of 0°C. The gas is then taken through the following
four-step process.

* A250 kg metal block is placed on top of the piston, compressing the gas to state 2, with the gas still at 0°C.

* The cylinder is then brought in contact with a boiling water bath, raising the gas temperature to 100°C at
state 3

‘* The metal block is removed and the gas expands to state 4 still at 100°C.
‘* Finally, the cylinder is again placed in contact with the water bath at 0°C, returning the system to state 1
