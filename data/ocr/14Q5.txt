A conducting rod of mass m and length L hangs at rest from two identical conducting springs, each with spring
constant k, as shown in the figure at left above. The upper ends of the springs are fixed at points P and Q, and the
rod is in a uniform magnetic field B directed into the page. A battery is then connected between points P and Q,
as shown in the figure at right above, resulting in a current / in the rod. The rod is displaced downward,
eventually reaching a new equilibrium position with the springs stretched an additional distance Ay.
