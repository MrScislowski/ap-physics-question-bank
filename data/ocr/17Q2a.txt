(a) Describe an experiment for determining the coefficient of static friction between the wood board and the
‘wood block. Assume equipment usually found in a school physics laboratory is available.

i, Draw a diagram of the experimental setup of the board and block. In your diagram, indicate each
‘quantity that would be measured and draw or state what equipment would be used to measure each
quantity.

ii, Describe the overall procedure to be used, including any steps necessary to reduce experimental
uncertainty, Give enough detail so that another student could replicate the experiment,
