‘The experiment is performed many times with spheres of identical known mass but different unknown charges,
each time adjusting the potential difference V to the value needed so that the sphere falls at constant speed v.
‘The magnitudes of the charges are calculated from the measured values of the potential difference. The data is
plotted below as a function of the magnitude of V.
