i, On the diagram below, draw and label the forces (not components) that act on the wheel as it rolls,
down the ramp, which is indicated by the dashed line. To clearly indicate at which point on the whee!
each force is exerted, draw each force as a distinct arrow starting on, and pointing away from, the point
at which the force is exerted. The lengths of the arrows need not indicate the relative magnitudes of the
forces

ii. As the wheel rolls down the ramp, which force causes a change in the angular velocity of the wheel
with respect to its center of mass?

Briefly explain your reasoning,
