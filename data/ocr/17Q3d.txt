For parts (d) and (e), do NOT assume that the rod is much more massive than the disk.

(d) Immediately before colliding with the rod, the disk’s rotational inertia about the pivot is mgi, x° and its
angular momentum with respect to the pivot is mgiy.vp.x- Derive an equation for the posteollision angular
speed oof the rod, Express your answer in terms of d, mag.» 4.% Yo » and physical constants, as appropriate.
