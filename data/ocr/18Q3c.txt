(©) In another experiment, the disk again has an initial positive angular velocity @, at time ¢ = 0.

time ¢ = 54, the student starts dripping oil on the contact surface between the axle and the disk to reduce

the friction. As time passes, more and more oil reaches that contact surface, reducing the friction even
further.

i. On the grid at left below, sketch a graph that could represent the disk’s angular velocity as a
function of time from ¢ = 0 10 1 = f,, which isthe time at which the disk came to rest in part (a,

ii, On the grid at right below, sketch the disk’s angular acceleration as a funetion of time
from 1 = 010 = 4
