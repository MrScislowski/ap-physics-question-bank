Your teacher gives you two speakers that are in phase and are emitting the same frequency of sound, which is
between 5000 and 10,000 Hz. She asks you to determine this frequency more precisely. She does not have a
frequency or wavelength meter in the lab, so she asks you to design an interference experiment to determine the
frequency. The speed of sound is 340 m/s at the temperature of the lab room.
