A sealed steel canister is being used to store neon gas (atomic mass = 20.2 u). The mass of the steel canister
alone is 12.0 kg, and it has an interior volume of 8.00 liters = 8.00 x 107 m>. There are 4.50 moles of neon
‘gas in the canister, and the temperature of the entire system is 300 K.

Reference information:
Specific heat of steel = 448 Jkg™! K7!
Specific heat of neon = 12.5 J mole~! K~!
Specific heat of water = 4186 J kg™! K7!
