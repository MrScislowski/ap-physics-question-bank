In the experimental setup represented above, a very small plastic sphere of mass m with charge q is allowed to
fall under the influence of gravity between two parallel metal plates separated by a fixed distance L.A variable
potential difference may be applied between the two plates. The experiment is conducted inside a vacuum.
