A student performs a photoelectric effect experiment in which light of various frequencies is incident on a
photosensitive metal plate. This plate, a second metal plate, and a power supply are connected in a circuit,
which also contains two meters, M, and M,, as shown above.

The student shines light of a specific wavelength A onto the plate. The voltage on the power supply is then
adjusted until there is no more current in the circuit, and this voltage is recorded as the stopping potential Vs

The student then repeats the experiment several more times with different wavelengths of light. The data, along
with other values calculated from it, are recorded in the table below.
