A platinum resistor has a resistance that changes with temperature. Values of the resistance were obtained exper~
imentally for several temperatures from 5°C to 30°C only and plotted on the graph above. Design a procedure in
which this resistor can be used as a thermometer to measure the temperature of a liquid that is in the 50°C to
75°C range. The resistor can be safely immersed in liquids. Along with the resistor and the container of the
liquid of unknown temperature, the following equipment and materials may be used.

Power supply
Ammeter (Note: The ammeter and the voltmeter cannot
Voltmeter _be used directly as an ohmmeter.)

Connecting wires

Iee-water bath

Boiling-water bath
