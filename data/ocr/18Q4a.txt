(a) Two dots have been painted on the string. In the diagrams below, those dots are labeled P and Q.

i, The figure below shows the string at an instant in time. At the instant shown, dot P has maximum,
displacement and dot @ has zero displacement from equilibrium. At each of the dots P and Q, draw an
arrow indicating the direction of the instantaneous velocity of that dot. If either dot has zero velocity,
write “v = 0" next to the dot.

Direction of Wave

ii, The figure below shows the string at the same instant as shown in part (ai. At each of the dots P and
Q, draw an arrow indicating the direction of the instantaneous acceleration of that dot. If either dot has
zero acceleration, write “a = 0” next to the dot.
