(a) The students want to determine the resistivity of the dough cylinders.

i, Indicate below which quantities could be graphed to determine a value for the resistivity of the dough
cylinders. You may use the remaining columns in the table above, as needed, to record any quantities
(including units) that are not already in the table.

Vertical Axi Horizontal Axis:

ii, On the grid below, plot the appropriate quantities to determine the resistivity of the dough cylinders.
Clearly scale and label all axes, including units as a

ili, Use the above graph to estimate a value for the resistivity of the dough cylinders.
