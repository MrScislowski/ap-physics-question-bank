3. (12 points, suggested time 25 minutes)

A long track, inclined at an angle @ to the horizontal, has small speed bumps on it. The bumps are evenly
spaced a distance d apart, as shown in the figure above. The track is actually much longer than shown, with over
100 bumps. A cart of mass M is released from rest at the top of the track. A student notices that after reaching
the 40th bump the cartâ€™s average speed between successive bumps no longer increases, reaching a maximum

value v,,,. This means the time interval taken to move from one bump to the next bump becomes constant,
