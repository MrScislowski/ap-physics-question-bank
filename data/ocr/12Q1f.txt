(f)_ If this system is set up in a laboratory and the acceleration of the 1.5 kg block is experimentally determined,
the experimental value is found to be smaller than the value calculated above. If the given value for the
coefficient of friction is correct and air resistance is negligible, explain briefly, but specifically, why the
â€˜experimental value of the acceleration is smaller.
