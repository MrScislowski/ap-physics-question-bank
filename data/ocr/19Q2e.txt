(e) While the blocks are accelerating, the tension in the vertical portion of the string is 7;. Next, the pulley of

negligible mass is replaced with a second pulley whose mass is not negligible. When the blocks are
accelerating in this scenario, the tension in the vertical portion of the string is 73. How do the two tensions,

compare to each other?

T>T, Ty =1, 1, <7,

Briefly explain your reasoning.
