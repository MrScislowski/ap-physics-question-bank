(Â©) A student carries out the experiment and analysis described in parts (a) and (b). The student immediately
concludes that something went wrong in the experiment because the graph or table shows behavior that is,
elastic for low-speed collisions but appears to violate a basic physics principle for high-speed collisions.

i. Give an example of a graph or table that indicates nearly elastic behavior for low-speed collisions but
appears to violate a basic physics principle for high-speed collisions.

ii, State one physics principle that appears to be violated in the graph or table given in part (ci.
Several physics principles might appear to be violated, but you only need to identify one.

Briefly explain what aspect of the graph or table indicates that the physics principle is violated,
and why.
