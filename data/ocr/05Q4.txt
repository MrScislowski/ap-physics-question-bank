Your teacher gives you a slide with two closely spaced slits on it. She also gives you a laser with a wavelength
2. = 632 nm, The laboratory task that you are assigned asks you to determine the spacing between the slits
These slits are so close together that you cannot measure their spacing with a typical measuring device.
