Double Slits

3. (15 points)

A microwave source is placed behind two identical slits, as represented in the diagram above. The slit centers are
separated by a distance of 0.20 m, and the slit widths are small compared to the slit separation but not negligible.

â€˜The microwave wavelength is 2.4 x 10 m. The resulting interference pattern is centered on a screen 0.60 m
wide, located 2.5 m from the slits.
