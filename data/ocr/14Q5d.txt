An experiment is conducted with batteries of different emf connected between points P and Q. The current / it
the rod and the stretch of the springs Ay are measured and recorded in the table below.

T(amperes) | Ay (meters)

10 0.0028
2.0 0.0050
3.0 0.0084
4.0 0.0119

5.0 0.0140

(d) On the grid below, plot the data points for Ay as a function of J. Be sure to label your axes with variables,
units, and scale, Draw a straight line that best represents the data,
