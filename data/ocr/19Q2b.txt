(b) Now suppose neither blockâ€™s mass is much greater than the other, but that they are not necessarily equal.
The dots below represent block A and block B, as indicated by the labels. On each dot, draw and label the
forces (not components) exerted on that block after release. Represent each force by a distinct arrow starting
on, and pointing away from, the dot.

Block A Block B
