A cylinder with a movable piston contains 0.1 mole of a monatomic ideal gas. The gas, initially at state a, can be
taken through either of two cycles, abca or abcda, as shown on the PV diagram above. The following
information is known about this system.

Q,-44 = 685 J along the curved path
Weg = 7120 J along the curved path
U, =U, =4503

Wasps = 750
