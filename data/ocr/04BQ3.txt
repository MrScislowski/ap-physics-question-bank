A vibrating tuning fork is held above a column of air, as shown in the diagrams above. The reservoir is raised
and lowered to change the water level, and thus the length of the column of air. The shortest length of air column
that produces a resonance is L, = 0.25 m., and the next resonance is heard when the air column is Ly = 0.80 m

long. The speed of sound in air at 20Â°C is 343 m/s and the speed of sound in water is 1490 m/s.
