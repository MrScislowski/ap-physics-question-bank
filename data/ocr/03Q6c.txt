‘The diver finds a rectangular aluminum plate having dimensions 1.0 m x 2.0 m x 0.03 m. A hoisting cable is

lowered from the ship and the diver connects it to the plate, The density of aluminum is 2.7 x 10" kg/m’. Ignore
the effects of viscosity.

(c) Calculate the tens

mn in the cable if it lifts the plate upward at a slow, constant velocity.
