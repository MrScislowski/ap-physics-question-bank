(a) On the axes below, sketch and label graphs of the following two quantities as a function of the position
of the block between x = ~D and x = 3D. You do not need to calculate values for the vertical axis, but the
same vertical scale should be used for both quantities.

i, The kinetic energy K of the block

ii, The potential energy U of the block-spring system
