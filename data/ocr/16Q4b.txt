Resistor B is now removed from the circuit, and there is no connection between the wires that were attached to it.
â€˜The new circuit diagram is shown below.

(b) When resistor B is removed, does the current through resistor A increase, decrease, or remain the same?
Increase Decrease Remain the same

Briefly explain your reasoning.
