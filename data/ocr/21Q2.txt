A group of students is investigating how the thickness of a plastic rod affects the maximum force Fina With which
the rod can be pulled without breaking, Two students are discussing models to represent how Figx depends on rod
thickness.

Student A claims that Fray is directly proportional to the radius of the rod.

Student B claims that Fjyax is directly proportional to the cross-sectional area of the rodâ€”the area of the base of the
cylinder, shaded gray in the figure above.
