Block B

2. (12 points, suggested time 25 minutes)
This problem explores how the relative masses of two blocks affect the acceleration of the blocks. Block A, of
â€˜mass m , rests on a horizontal tabletop, There is negligible friction between block A and the tabletop, Block B,
of mass m,,, hangs from a light string that runs over a pulley and attaches to block A, as shown above. The

and spins with negligible friction about its axle. The blocks are released from rest.
