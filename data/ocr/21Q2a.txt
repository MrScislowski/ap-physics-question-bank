(a) The students have a collection of many rods of the same material. The rods are all the same length but come
in a range of six different thicknesses. Design an experimental procedure to determine which student’s model,
iffeither, correctly represents how Fiyqx depends on rod thickness,

In the table below, list the quantities that would be measured in your experiment. Define a symbol to represent
each quantity, and also list the equipment that would be used to measure each quantity. You do not need to fill
in every row. If you need additional rows, you may add them to the space just below the table.

Describe the overall procedure to be used, referring to the table. Provide enough detail so that another student
‘could replicate the experiment, including any steps necessary to reduce experimental uncertainty. As needed,
use the symbols defined in the table and/or include a simple diagram of the setup.
