â€˜The electron encounters a particle with the same mass and opposite charge (a positron) moving with the same
speed in the opposite direction. The two particles undergo a head-on collision, which results in the disappearance
of both particles and the production of two photons of the same energy,

(c) Determine the energy of each photon.
