A world-class runner can complete a 100 m dash in about 10 s, Past studies have shown that runners in such a
race accelerate uniformly for a time 4, and then run at constant speed for the remainder of the race, A world-

class runner is visiting your physics class. You are to develop a procedure that will allow you to determine the
uniform acceleration a, and an approximate value of Â¢, for the runner in a 100 m dash, By necessity your

experiment will be done on a

traight track and include your whole class of eleven students.
