‘The experimental diving bell shown above is lowered from rest at the ocean's surface and reaches @ maximum
depth of 80 m. Initially it accelerates downward at a rate of 0.10 m/s? until it reaches a speed of 2.0 m/s,
which then remains constant. During the descent, the pressure inside the bell remains constant at 1 atmosphere.
‘The top of the bell has a cross-sectional area A = 9,0 m?, The density of seawater is 1025 kg/m?
