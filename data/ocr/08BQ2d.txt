Now assume the bed of the truck is frictionless, but there is a spring of spring constant 9200 N/m attaching the
crate to the truck, as shown below. The truck is initially at rest

(d) If the truck and crate have the same acceleration, calculate the extension of the spring as the truck
accelerates from rest to 25 m/s in 10s.
