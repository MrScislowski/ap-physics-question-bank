To operate the motor, the student has available only a 9.0 V battery to use as the power source and the following
five resistors.

wo
10002 40002 40002-50002 ~——10,000

(4) In the space below, complete a schematic diagram of a circuit that shows how one or more of these resistors
can be connected to the battery and motor so that 1.0 mA of current and 3.0 V of potential difference are
supplied to the motor. Be sure to label each resistor in the circuit with the correct value of its resistance.
