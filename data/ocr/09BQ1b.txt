â€˜The procedure is repeated, and the period P is determined for four different values of my , where

m, = 0.012 kg and r = 0.80 m. The data, which are presented below, can be used to compute an
experimental value for g.

m, (kg) |0.020 [0.040 | 0.060 | 0.080
Ps) 1.40 1.05 0.80 0.75

(b) What quantities should be graphed to yield a straight line with a slope that could be used to determine g
