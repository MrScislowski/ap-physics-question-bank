Glass

4. (1S points)
In an experiment a beam of red light of wavelength 675 nm in air passes from glass into air, as shown above.
The incident and refracted angles are @, and @,, respectively. In the experiment, angle 8, is measured for
various angles of incidence @,, and the sines of the angles are used to obtain the line shown in the following
â€˜graph.
