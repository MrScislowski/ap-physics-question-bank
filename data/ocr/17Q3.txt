3. (12 points, suggested time 25 minutes)
â€˜The left end of a rod of length d and rotational inertia / i attached to a frictionless horizontal surface by a
frictionless pivot, as shown above. Point C marks the center (midpoint) of the rod, The rod is initially motionless
but is free to rotate around the pivot. A student will slide a disk of mass my. toward the rod with velocity vp

perpendicular to the rod, and the disk will stick to the rod a distance x from the pivot. The student wants the rod-
disk system to end up with as much angular speed as possible.
