A physics class consisting of six lab groups wants to test the hypothesis that the coefficient of static friction
between the board and the block equals the coefficient of kinetic friction between the board and the block. Each
group determines the coefficients of kinetic and static friction between the board and the block. The groups’
results are shown below, with the class averages indicated in the bottom row.

Lab] Coefficient | Coefficient
Group | of Kinetic | of Stati

Number | Friction | Friction
∣ ∘⊿≤ 0.54
2 0.46 0.52
3 0.42 0.56
4 0.43 0.55
5 0.74 0.23
6 0.44 0.54

‘Average | 0.49 0.49

(©) Based on these data, what conclusion should the students make about the hypothesis that the coefficients of
static and kinetic friction are equal”?

‘The static and kinetic coefficients are equal.
‘The static and kinetic coefficients are not equal

Briefly justify your reasoning.
