A beaker weighing 2.0 N is filled with 5.0 x 10-° m° of water. A rubber ball weighing 3.0 N is held entirely
underwater by a massless string attached to the bottom of the beaker, as represented in the figure above. The
tension in the string is 4,0 N. The water fills the beaker to a depth of 0.20 m, Water has a density of

1000 kg/m* . The effects of atmospheric pressure may be neglected.
