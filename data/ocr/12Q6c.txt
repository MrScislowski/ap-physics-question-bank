(Â©) A more accurate experimental value can be obtained by varying one of the measured quantities to obtain
multiple sets of data. Indicate one quantity that can be Varied, and describe how a graph of the resulting data
could be used to determine the speed of sound. Clearly identify independent and dependent variables, and
indicate how the slope of the graph relates to the speed of sound.
