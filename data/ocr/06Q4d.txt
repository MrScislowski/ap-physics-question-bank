Light Source

Air
Oil film
Water

‘The student is also asked to determine the thickness of a film of oil (n = 1.43) on the surface of water (n = 1.33).
Light from a variable wavelength source is incident vertically onto the oil film as shown above. The student
measures a maximum in the intensity of the reflected light when the incident light has a wavelength of 600 nm.

(d) At which of the two interfaces does the light undergo a 180° phase change on reflection?
__The air-oil interface only The oil-water interface only

__Both interfaces __Neither interface
