‘The plastic cart shown in the figure above has mass 2.5 kg and moves with negligible friction on a horizontal
surface. Attached to the cart is a rigid rectangular loop of wire that is 0.10 m by 0.20 m, has resistance 4.0.0,
and has a mass that is negligible compared to the mass of the cart. The plane of the rectangular loop is parallel to
the plane of the page. A uniform magnetic field of 2.0 T, perpendicular to and directed into the plane of the page,
starts at x = 0, as shown above.
