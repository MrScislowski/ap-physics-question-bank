(a) Consider the cart’s motion between bump 41 and bump 44.

i, In the figure below, sketch a graph of the cart’s velocity v as a function of time from the moment it
reaches bump 41 until the moment it reaches bump 44.

ii, Over the same time interval, draw a dashed horizontal line at v = v,,,- Label this line “v4.”
