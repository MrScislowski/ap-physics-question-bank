Before Collision After Collision

In another experiment on the same table, the target ball B is replaced by target ball C of mass 0.10 kg. The
incident ball A again slides at 1.4 m/s, as shown above left, but this time makes a glancing collision with the
target ball C that is at rest at the edge of the table, The target ball C strikes the floor at point P, which is at a
horizontal displacement of 0.15 m from the point of the collision, and at a horizontal angle of 30Â° from the
sre-axis, as shown above right.

(c) Calculate the speed v of the target ball C immediately after the collision.
