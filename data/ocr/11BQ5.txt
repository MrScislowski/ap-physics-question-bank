Region 1

5. (15 points)
The diagram above illustrates a velocity selector, labeled region 1. It consists of two parallel conducting
plates, with charges on the plates as indicated creating an electric field of magnitude E directed toward the
top of the page. A uniform magnetic field of magnitude B, directed out of the page exists between the plates.
â€˜The magnitude of the magnetic field can be adjusted so that only particles of a particular speed pass through the
selector in a straight line. A radioactive source to the left of the selector emits charged particles, each having the
same charge +q and moving to the right in the plane of the page. The effect of gravity can be neglected

throughout the problem.
