The large container shown in the cross section above is filled with a liquid of density 1.1 10° kg/m? . A small

hole of area 2.5 x 10° m? is opened in the side of the container a distance h below the liquid surface, which
allows a stream of liquid to flow through the hole and into a beaker placed to the right of the container. At the
same time, liquid is also added to the container at an appropriate rate so that ft remains constant. The amount of

liquid collected in the beaker in 2.0 minutes is 7.2 x 10 m?.
