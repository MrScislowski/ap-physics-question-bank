A rail gun is a device that propels a projectile using a magnetic force. A simplified diagram of this device is
shown above. The projectile in the picture is a bar of mass M and length D, which has a constant current
flowing through it in the +y-direction, as shown. The space between the thin frictionless rails contains a uniform
magnetic field B, perpendicular to the plane of the page. The magnetic field and rails extend for a distance L.
‘The magnetic field exerts a constant force F on the projectile, as shown,

Express all algebraic answers to the following parts in terms of the mag
‘other quantities given above, and fundamental constants.
