A constant magnetic field of magnitude B, directed into the page is now added in region 2 to the right of
region 1, as represented in the figure below. Suppose a particle leaves the radioactive source, travels through
region 1 in a straight line, and enters region 2. For each of the following, express algebraic answers in terms
of E, By, By, q, and fundamental constants, as appropriate.
