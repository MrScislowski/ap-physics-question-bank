A group of students prepare a large batch of conductive dough (a soft substance that can conduct electricity) and
then mold the dough into several cylinders with various cross-sectional areas A and lengths . Each student

applies a potential difference AV across the ends of a dough cylinder and determines the resistance Rof the
cylinder. The results of their experiments are shown in the table below.
