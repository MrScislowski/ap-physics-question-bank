Suppose that various rectangular loops with the same total length of wire as found in part (a) were constructed
such that the lengths of the horizontal segments of the wire loops varied between 0,02 m and 0.10 m. The
horizontal segment of each loop was always centered between the poles, and the current in each loop was always
4.0 A. The following graph represents the theoretical relationship between the magnitude of the force on the
magnet and the length of the wire.

(d) On the graph above, sketch a possible relationship between the magnitude of the force on the magnet and the
length of the wire segment if the wire segments were misaligned and placed at a constant nonperpendicular
angle to the magnetic field, as shown below.
