4, (7 points, suggested time 13 minutes)

â€˜Two identical spheres are released from a device at time f = 0 from the same height H, as shown above.
Sphere A has no initial velocity and falls straight down. Sphere B is given an initial horizontal velocity of
magnitude vy and travels a horizontal distance D before it reaches the ground. The spheres reach the ground at

the same time f,, even though sphere B has more distance to cover before landing. Air resistance is negligible.
