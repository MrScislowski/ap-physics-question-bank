Block A of mass 2.0 kg and block B of mass 8.0 kg are connected as shown above by a spring of spring constant
80 N/m and negligible mass. The system is being pulled to the right across a horizontal frictionless surface by a
horizontal force of 4.0 N, as shown, with both blocks experiencing equal constant acceleration.
