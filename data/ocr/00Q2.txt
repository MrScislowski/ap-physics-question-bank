Blox respectively, are connected by alight string, as shown above. These
blocks are further connected to a block of mass M by another light string that passes over a pulley of negligible
mass and friction. Blocks | and 2 move with a constant velocity v down the inclined plane, which makes an

angle @ with the horizontal. The kinetic frictional force on block | is f and that on block 2 is 2f.
