2. (15 points)

An incident ball A of mass 0.10 kg is sliding at 1.4 m/s on the horizontal tabletop of negligible friction shown
above. It makes a head-on collision with a target ball B of mass 0.50 kg at rest at the edge of the table. As a
result of the collision, the incident ball rebounds, sliding backwards at 0.70 m/s immediately after the collision.
