A particle with unknown mass and charge moves with constant speed v= 1.9 x 10° mis as it passes undeflected
through a pair of parallel plates, as shown above. The plates are separated by a distance d= 6.0 x 10 m, and a
constant potential difference V is maintained between them. A uniform magnetic field of magnitude B = 0.20'T
directed into the page exists both between the plates and in a region to the right of them as shown. After the
particle passes into the region to the right of the plates where only the magnetic field exists, its trajectory is
circular with radius r= 0.10 m.
