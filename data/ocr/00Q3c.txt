After the capacitor is fully charged, switches S, and S, remain open, switch 5 remains closed, the plates are held
fixed, and a conducting copper block is inserted midway between the plates, as shown below. The plates of the
capacitor are separated by a distance of 1.0 mm, and the copper block has a thickness of 0.5 mm,

1.0 mm Copper

(Â©) i, Whatis the potential difference between the plates?
ii, What is the electric field inside the copper block?

On the diagram above, draw arrows to clearly indicate the direction of the electric field between the
plates.

iv. Determine the magnitude of the electric field in each of the spaces between the plates and the copper
block.
