(e) If the wavelength of light is decreased while the power per unit area (intensity) of the incident light stays
the same, does the number of electrons emitted from the metal surface per unit time increase, decrease, or
remain the same? (Assume that the light is initially above the threshold frequency.)

Increases Decreases Remains the same

Justify your answer.
