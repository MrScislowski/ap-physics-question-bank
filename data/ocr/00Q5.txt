A sodium photoelectric surface with work function ated by electromagnetic radiation and emits
electrons. The electrons travel toward a negatively charged cathode and complete the circuit shown above. The
potential difference supplied by the power supply is increased, and when it reaches 4.5 V, no electrons reach the
cathode.
