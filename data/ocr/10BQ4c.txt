(Â©) What is the direction of the magnetic field, if any, at point P, which is in the plane of the page?
___ To the left ___ Toward the top of the page ___ Out of the plane of the page
othe right _ Toward the bottom of the page -__Into the plane of the page
___None of the above, because the magnetic field is zero
