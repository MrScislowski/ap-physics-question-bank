(b) Without M or H being changed, the time interval At can be decreased by adding one re:
resistance R,,, where R, > R,, tothe circuit shown above. How should the resistor of resistance R

be added to the circuit to decrease At ?

_â€”Inparallel with _In parallel_-__In parallel with ___ In series with the battery,
the battery with Ry the motor R,-and the motor

In a clear, coherent, paragraph-length response that may also contain figures and/or equations, justify why
your selection would decrease At.
