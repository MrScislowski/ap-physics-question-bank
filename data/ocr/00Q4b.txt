(b) Next a thin film of material is to be tested on the glass sheet for use in making reflective coatings. The film
has an index of refraction; = 1.38. White light is incident normal to the surface of the film as shown

below. It is observed that at a point where the light is incident on the film, light reflected from the surface
appears green (2 = 525 nm).

i, What is the frequency of the green light in air
ii, What is the frequency of the green light in the film?
ii, What is the wavelength of the green light in the film?

iv. Calculate the minimum thickness of film that would produce this green reflection.
