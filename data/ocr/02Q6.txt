density p of the fluid. You are to use a spring of negligible mass and unknown spring constant k attached to a

stand, An irregularly shaped object of known mass m and density D (D >> p) hangs from the spring. You may
also choose from among the following items to complete the task.

# A metric ruler
# A stopwatch
* String
