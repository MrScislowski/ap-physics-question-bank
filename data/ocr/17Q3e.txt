(Â¢) Consider the collision for which your equation in part (d) was derived, except now suppose the disk bounces
backward off the rod instead of sticking to the rod. Is the postcollision angular speed of the rod when the
disk bounces off it greater than, less than, or equal to the postcollision angular speed of the rod when the
disk sticks to it?

Greater than Less than Equal to
Briefly explain your reasoning.
