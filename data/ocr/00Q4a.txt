(a) Monochromatic light is incident on the glass sheet, as shown in the figure below, at an angle of incidence
of 60Â°. On the figure, sketch the path the light takes the first time it strikes each of the two parallel surfaces.
Calculate and label the size of each angle (in degrees) on the figure, including angles of incidence,
reflection, and refraction at each of the two parallel surfaces shown.
