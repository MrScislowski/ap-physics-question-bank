Ina double-slit interference experiment, a parallel beam of monochromatic light is needed to illuminate two
narrow parallel slits of width w that are a distance b apart in an opaque card as shown in the figure above. A lens
is inserted between the point light source S and the slits in order to produce the parallel beam of light. The
interference pattern is formed on a screen a distance D from the slits, where D >> b.
