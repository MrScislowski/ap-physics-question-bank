â€˜A 20-turn wire coil in the shape of a rectangle, 0.25 m by 0.15 m, has a resistance of 5.0. In position 1 shown
above, the loop is in a uniform magnetic field B of 0.20 T. The field is directed out of the page, perpendicular to
the plane of the loop. The loop is pulled tothe right at a constant velocity, reaching position 2 in 0.50 s, where B
is equal to zero.
