Mercury
3. (10 points)

A glass U-tube with a uniform diameter of 0.850 cm is used to determine the density of an oil. As shown in the
figure above, a 24,5 cm column of water balances a 27.2 em column of the oil so that interfaces A and B of the

mercury with the other liquids are at the same height. The density of water is 1.00 x 10Â° kg/m}.
