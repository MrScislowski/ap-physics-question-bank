A student is asked to experimentally determine the index of refraction of the semicircular block of transparent
plastic shown in the figure above. The student aims a red laser beam of wavelength 2 = 632. nm at the center of
the flat side of the block, as shown. The ray is refracted from air into the plastic and strikes the semicircular side
of the block perpendicularly. The student uses a protractor to aim the laser at several different angles of

incidence @, between 0° and 90° and to measure the angles of refraction @, . The student’s data are given in the

table below.
