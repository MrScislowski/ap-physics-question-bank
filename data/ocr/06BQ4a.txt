(a) Part of the incident ray is reflected and part is refracted at the first interface.

i, Determine the angle of reflection at the first interface. Draw and label the reflected ray on the
diagram above.

ii, Determine the angle of refraction at the first interface. Draw and label the refracted ray on the
diagram above,
