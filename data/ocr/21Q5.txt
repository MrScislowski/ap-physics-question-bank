‘Two pulleys with different radii are attached to each other so that they rotate together about a horizontal axle
through their common center. There is negligible friction in the axle. Object 1 hangs from a light string
‘wrapped around the larger pulley, while object 2 hangs from another light string wrapped around the smaller
pulley, as shown in the figure above.

‘mg is the mass of object 1
15g is the mass of object 2

ris the radius of the smaller pulley.
2y is the radius of the larger pulley.
