A motor is a device that when connected to a battery converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. The
motor shown above is used to lift a block of mass M at constant speed from the ground to a height H above the
ground in a time interval At. The motor has constant resistance and is connected in series with a resistor of
resistance R, and a battery.

4. (7 points, suggested time 13 minutes)

Mechanical power, the rate at which mechanical work is done on the block, increases if the potential difference
(voltage drop) between the two terminals of the motor increases.
