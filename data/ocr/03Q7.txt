Energy-level diagrams for atoms that comprise a helium-neon laser are given above. As indicated on the left, the
helium atom is excited by an electrical discharge and an electron jumps from energy level Eo to energy level Ey
The helium atom (atomic mass 4) then collides inelastically with a neon atom (atomic mass 20), and the helium

atom falls to the ground state, giving the neon atom enough energy to raise an electron from Ey’ to E>’. The

laser emits light when an electron in the neon atom falls from energy level Ey’ to energy level Ey’.
