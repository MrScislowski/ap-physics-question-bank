(b) For this ramp angle, the force of friction exerted on the wheel is less than the maximum possible static
friction force. Instead, the magnitude of the force of static friction exerted on the wheel is 40 percent of the
‘magnitude of the force or force component directed opposite to the force of friction. Derive an expression
for the linear acceleration of the wheel’s center of mass in terms of M, 8, and physical constants, as
appropriate.
