Following a nuclear reaction, a nucleus of aluminum is at rest in an excited state represented by {}Al*, as shown
above left. The excited nucleus returns to the ground state {jAl by emitting a gamma ray photon of energy

1,02 MeV, as shown above right. The aluminum nucleus in the ground state has a mass of 4.48 x 10° kg.
Assume nonrelativistic equations apply to the motion of the nucleus,
