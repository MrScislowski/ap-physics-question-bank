In the circuit above, the battery of emf â‚¬ is connected to two long, straight, parallel wires, which in turn are
connected to four resistors with resistances given in the figure above. Assume that any other resistances in the
circuit are negligible. Express all algebraic answers to the following parts in terms of the given quantities and
fundamental constants.
