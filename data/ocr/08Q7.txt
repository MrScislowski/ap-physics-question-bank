In an electron microscope, a tungsten cathode with work function 4.5 eV is heated to release electrons that are
then initially at rest just outside the cathode. The electrons are accelerated by a potential difference to create a
beam of electrons with a de Broglie wavelength of 0.038 nm. Assume nonrelativistic equations apply to the
motion of the electrons.
