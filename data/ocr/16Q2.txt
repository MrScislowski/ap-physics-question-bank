A new kind of toy ball is advertised to “bounce perfectly elastically” off hard surfaces. A student suspects,
however, that no collision can be perfectly elastic. The student hypothesizes that the collisions are very close to
being perfectly elastic for low-speed collisions but that they deviate more and more from being perfectly elast
as the collision speed increases.
