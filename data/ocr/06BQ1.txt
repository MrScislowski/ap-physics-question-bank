A student wishing to determine experimentally the acceleration g due to gravity has an apparatus that holds
aa small steel sphere above a recording plate, as shown above. When the sphere is released, a timer automatically
begins recording the time of fall. The timer automatically stops when the sphere strikes the recording plate.

â€˜The student measures the time of fall for different values of the distance D shown above and records the data in
the table below. These data points are also plotted on the graph.
