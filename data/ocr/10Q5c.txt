(Â©) The incident beam is now perpendicular to the surface. The glass is coated with a thin film that has an index
of refraction n, = 1.38 to reduce the partial reflection of the beam at this angle.

i, Calculate the wavelength of the red light in the film.

|. Calculate the minimum thickness of the film for which the inter

zero.

ity of the reflected red ray is near
