(c) Ina second experiment on the same ramp, a block of ice, also with mass M, is released from rest at the same
instant the wheel is released from rest, and from the same height. The block slides down the ramp with
negligible friction.

i, Which object, if either, reaches the bottom of the ramp with the greatest speed?
Wheel Block Neither; both reach the bottom with the same speed.
Briefly explain your answer, reasoning in terms of forces.

ii, Briefly explain your answer again, now reasoning in terms of energy
