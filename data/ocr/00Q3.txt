3. (15 points)

‘Three identical resistors, each with resistance R, and a capacitor of 1.0 x 10° F are connected to a 30 V battery
with negligible internal resistance, as shown in the circuit diagram above. Switches S, and S, are initially closed,
and switch S; is initially open. A voltmeter is connected as shown.
