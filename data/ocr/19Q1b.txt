(b) ‘The plunger is retuned to its original position, and both blocks are removed. A uniform solid sphere is
placed at point A, as shown. The sphere is pushed by the plunger from point A to point B with a con:
horizontal force that is directed toward the sphere's center of mass. The sphere loses contact with the
plunger at point B and continues moving across the horizontal surface toward point E. In which interval(s),
iff any, does the sphere’s angular momentum about its center of mass change? Check all that apply.
