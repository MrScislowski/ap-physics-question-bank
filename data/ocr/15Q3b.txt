is now compressed twice as much, to Ax = 2D. A student is asked to predict whether the
final position of the block will be twice as far at x = 6D . The student reasons that since the spring will be
compressed twice as much as before, the block will have more energy when it leaves the spring, so it will slide
farther along the track before stopping at position x = 6D
