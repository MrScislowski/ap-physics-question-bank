(a) A student of mass Ms, standing on a smooth surface, uses a stick to push a disk of mass Mp. The student
exerts a constant horizontal force of magnitude Fj, over the time interval from time
pushing the disk. Assume there is negligible friction between the disk and the surface.

tor ty while

i. Assuming the disk begins at rest, determine an expression for the final speed vp of the disk relative
to the surface. Express your answer in terms of Fy, ty, Ms, Mp, and physical constants, as
appropriate.

ii, Assume there is negligible friction between the student's shoes and the surface. After time ty, the
student slides with speed vs. Derive an equation for the ratio vp/ vs. Express your answer in terms
of Ms, Mp, and physical constants, as appropriate.
