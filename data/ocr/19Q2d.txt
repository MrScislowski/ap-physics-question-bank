(@) Consider the scenario from part (a)(ii), where the mass of block A is much less than the mass of block B.
Does your equation for the acceleration of the blocks from part (c) agree with your reasoning in part (a)(ii) ?

——Yes  __No

Briefly explain your reasoning by addressing why, according to your equation, the acceleration becomes (or
approaches) a certain value when m, is much less than m,
