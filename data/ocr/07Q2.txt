Your research director has assigned you to set up the laboratory's mass spectrometer so that it will separate
strontium ions having a net charge of +2e from a beam of mixed ions. The spectrometer above accelerates a
beam of ions from rest through a potential difference € , after which the beam enters a region containing a
uniform magnetic field B of constant magnitude and perpendicular to the plane of the path of the ions. The ions
leave the spectrometer at a distance x from the entrance point. You can manually change €

Numerical values for this experiment:
Strontium atomic number: 38

‘Strontium ion mass: 1.45 x10 kg.

Magnitude of B field: 0.090 T
Desired exit distancex: 1.75 m
