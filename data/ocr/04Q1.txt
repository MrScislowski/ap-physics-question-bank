A roller coaster ride at an amusement park lifts a car of mass 700 kg to point A at a height of 90 m above the
lowest point on the track, as shown above. The car starts from rest at point A, rolls with negligible friction down
the incline and follows the track around a loop of radius 20 m, Point B, the highest point on the loop, is at a
height of 50 m above the lowest point on the track.
