The figure above shows a string with one end attached to an oscillator and the other end attached to a block. The
string passes over a massless pulley that turns with negligible friction. Four such strings, A, B, C, and D, are set
up side by side, as shown in the diagram below. Each oscillator is adjusted to vibrate the string at its fundamental
frequency f. The distance between each oscillator and pulley L. is the same, and the mass M of each block is the
same, However, the fundamental frequency of each string is different.

‘The equation for the velocity v of a wave on a string is v = where F, is the tension of the string

and m/L is the mass per unit length (linear mass density) of the string.
