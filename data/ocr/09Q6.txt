In a classroom demonstration, a beam of coherent light of wavelength 550 nm is incident perpendicularly
onto a pair of slits. Each slit has a width w of 1.2 x 10° m, and the distance d between the centers of the
slits is 1.8 x 10> m. The class observes light and dark fringes on a screen that is a distance L of 2.2 m

from the slits. Your notebook shows the following setup for the demonstration,
