2. (12 points, suggested time 25 minutes)

Some students want to know what gets used up candescent lightbulb when itis in series with a resistor:
current, energy, or both. They come up with the following two questions.

(1)_In one second, do fewer electrons leave the bulb than enter the bulb?
(2) Does the electric potential energy of electrons change while inside the bulb?

The students have an adjustable power source, insulated wire, lightbulbs, resistors
ammeters, and other standard lab equipment. Assume that the power supply and voltmeters are marked in 0.1.V
increments and the ammeters are marked in 0.01 A increments.
