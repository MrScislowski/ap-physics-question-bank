2. (10 points)

A beam of particles of charge g = +3.2 x 107! C and mass m = 6.68 x 10Â° kg enters region I with a range

of velocities all in the direction shown in the diagram above. There is a magnetic field in region I directed into
the page with magnitude B = 0.12 T. Charged metal plates are placed in appropriate locations to create a uniform
electric field of magnitude E = 4800 N/C in region I. As a result, some of the charged particles pass straight

through region I undeflected. Gravitational effects are negligible
