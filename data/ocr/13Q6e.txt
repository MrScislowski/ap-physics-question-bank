(e) With wire ¥ still above wire X, the circuit connected to wire Y is removed. Wire Y, which is 1.2 m long, is
then moved vertically up and away from wire X at a constant speed of 3.0 m/s,

i, Calculate the magnitude of the induced emf in wire ¥ when the wires are 0,050 m apart

ji, Indicate which end of wire Y is at a higher electric potential.
The leftend ____ The right end
___Neither end, since they are at the same electric potential
Justify your answer.
