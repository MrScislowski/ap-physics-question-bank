‘The wire loop is then used in an experiment to measure the strength of the magnetic field between the poles of
a magnet. The magnet is placed on a digital balance, and the wire loop is held fixed between the poles of the
magnet, as shown below. The 0.020 m long horizontal segment of the loop is midway between the poles and
perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field. The power supply in the loop is turned on, so that the 4.0 A.
current is in the direction shown.
