(e) Another pendulum using a thin, light, metal rod instead of a string is used in a clock to keep time. If the
temperature of the room was to increase significantly, what effect, if any, would this have on the period of
the pendulum?

It would increase. It would decrease. No effect. It would remain the same.

Justify your answer.
