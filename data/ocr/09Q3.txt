A metal rod of mass 0.22 kg lies across two parallel conducting rails that are a distance of 0.52 m apart on a
tabletop, as shown in the top view above. A 3.0 Q resistor is connected across the left ends of the rails. The
rod and rails have negligible resistance but signifi
There is a magnetic field of 0.80 T perpendicular to the plane of the tabletop. A string pulls the metal rod to
the right with a constant speed of 1.8 m/s.
