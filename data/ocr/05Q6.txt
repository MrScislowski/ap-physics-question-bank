An experiment is performed to determine the number n of moles of an ideal gas in the cylinder shown above.
The cylinder is fitted with a movable, frictionless piston of area A. The piston is in equilibrium and is supported
by the pressure of the gas. The gas is heated while its pressure P remains constant. Measurements are made of
the temperature T'of the gas and the height H of the bottom of the piston above the base of the cylinder and are
recorded in the table below. Assume that the thermal expansion of the apparatus can be ignored,
