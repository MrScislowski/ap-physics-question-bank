Disk Block

(©) The disk is now moving at a constant speed vy on the surface toward a block of mass Mg, which is at rest on
the surface, as shown above, The disk and block collide head-on and stick together, and the center of mass of,
the disk-block system moves with speed Yim,

i. Suppose the mass of the disk is much greater than the mass of the block. Estimate the velocity of

the center of mass of the disk-block system. Explain how you arrived at your prediction without
deriving it mathematically

Suppose the mass of the disk is much less than the mass of the block, Estimate the velocity of the
center of mass of the disk-block system. Explain how you arrived at your prediction without
deriving it mathematically

Now suppose that neither object’s mass is much greater than the other but that they are not
necessarily equal. Derive an equation for Yim. Express your answer in terms of vy, Mp, Mp, and
physical constants, as appropriate

iv. Consider the scenario from part (c)(i), where the mass of the disk was much greater than the mass
of the block. Does your equation for tiq_ from part (c)(iii) agree with your reasoning from part
(on)?

Yes _No
Explain your reasoning by addressing why, according to your equation, vig, becomes (or
approaches) a certain value when Mp is much greater than Mp
