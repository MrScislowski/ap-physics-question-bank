Another student, who does not have a magnetic field probe, uses a compass and the known value of Earth's
magnetic field to determine the magnetic field generated by the wire. With the current turned off, the student
places the compass 0.040 m from the wire, and the compass points directly toward the wire as shown below. The
student then turns on a 35 A current directed into the page.
