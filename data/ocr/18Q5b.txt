(b) The figure is reproduced above, How does the amplitude of oscillation App of the two-block system
compare with the original amplitude Ap of block P alone?

â€” Arg < Ae = Arg = Ap Arg > Ap

Ina clear, coherent paragraph-length response that may also contain diagrams and/or equations, explain your
reasoning.
