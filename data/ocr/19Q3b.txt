(b) Design an experimental procedure to test the hypothesis in which the student uses the Jauncher to Jaunch the
sphere. Assume equipment usually found in a school physics laboratory is available.

In the table below, list the quantities and associated symbols that would be measured in your experiment.
Also list the equipment that would be used to measure each quantity. You do not need to fill in every row.
If you need additional rows, you may add them to the space just below the table.

(b) Continued

Describe the overall procedure to be used to test the hypothesis that the spring constant of the spring inside
the launcher has the same value for different compression distances, referring to the table. Provide enough
detail so that another student could replicate the experiment, including any steps necessary to reduce
experimental uncertainty. As needed, use the symbols defined in the table and/or include a simple diagram
of the setup.
