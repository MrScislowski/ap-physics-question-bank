The apparatus shown above is used in determining the work function of a particular metal using the photoelectric
flict. The experiment is set up with an ammeter A and a variable power supply. A light source that emits
photons of frequency 7.5 x 10'* Hz is used. The emf € provided by the power supply is slowly increased from

zero until the ammeter shows that the current between the collector and metal emitter is zero. The magnitude of
the emf is 0.65 V when the current becomes zero.
