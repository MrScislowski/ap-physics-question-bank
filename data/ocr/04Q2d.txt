â€˜Suppose that the ocean liner came to rest at the surface of the ocean before it started to sink. Due to the
resistance of the seawater, the sinking ocean liner then reached a terminal velocity of 10.0m/s after falling
for 30.0

(d) Determine the magnitude a of the average acceleration of the ocean liner during this period of time.
