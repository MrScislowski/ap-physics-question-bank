(d) Before deriving an equation for a quantity such as v4... it can be useful to come up with an equation that is
intuitively expected to be true. That way, the derivation can be checked later to see if it makes sense

physically, A student comes up with the following equation for the cart's maximum average speed:
Mgsin@
d

i, To test the equation, the student rolls a cart down the long track with speed bumps many times in front
of a motion detector. The student varies the mass M of the cart with each trial but keeps everything else

the same, The graph shown below is the student's plot of the data for v,,_ as a function of M.

, where Cis a positive constant.

Yog =

0. -M (kg)
0 1 2 *

Are these data consistent with the student’s equation?
Yes __No
Briefly explain your reasoning,

ii, Another student suggests that whether or not the data above are consistent with the equation, the
‘equation could be incorrect for other reasons. Does the equation make physical sense?

Yes No
Briefly explain your reasoning,
