Compressed Released Spring at
Spring on Table Maximum Height

1. (15 points)
In an experiment, students are to calculate the spring constant & of a vertical spring in a small jumping toy
that initially rests on a table. When the spring in the toy is compressed a distance x from its uncompressed
length Ly and the toy is released, the top of the toy rises to a maximum height / above the point of maximum,
compression. The students repeat the experiment several times, measuring ht with objects of various masses

taped to the top of the toy so that the combined mass of the toy and added objects is m. The bottom of the toy
and the spring each have negligible mass compared to the top of the toy and the objects taped to it
