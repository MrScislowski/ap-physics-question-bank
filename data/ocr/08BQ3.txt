‘A student is measuring the magnetic field generated by a long, straight wire carrying a constant current. A
magnetic field probe is held at various distances d from the wire, as shown above, and the magnetic field is
measured. The graph below shows the five data points the student measured and a best-fit curve for the data.

Unfortunately, the student forgot about Earth’s magnetic field, which has a value of 5.0 x 10 Tat this,
location and is directed north.
