(b) The column of air in the tube is still resonating at its fundamental frequency. On the axes below, sketch a
graph of the maximum speed of air molecules as they oscillate in the tube, as a function of position x, from
+= 0 (left end of tube) to. = L (right end of tube). (Ignore random thermal motion of the air molecules.)
