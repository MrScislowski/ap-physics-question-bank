(d) The oil film now rests on a thick slab of glass with index of refraction 1.4, as shown in the figure below. A
light ray is incident on the film at the angle shown. On the figure, sketch the path of the refracted light ray
that passes through the film and the glass slab and exits into the air. Clearly show any bending of the ray at
each interface. You are NOT expected to calculate the sizes of any angles.
