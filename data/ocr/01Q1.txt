A ball of mass M is attached to a string of length R and negligible mass. The ball moves clockwise in a vertical
circle, as shown above. When the ball is at point P, the string is horizontal. Point Q is at the bottom of the circle
and point Z is at the top of the circle. Air resistance is negligible. Express all algebraic answers in terms of the
â€˜given quantities and fundamental constants.
