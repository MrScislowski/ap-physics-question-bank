A student is asked to determine the index of refraction of a glass slab. She conducts several trials for
measurement of angle of incidence @, in the air versus angle of refraction 8, in the glass at the surface of the
slab, She records her data in the following table. The index of refraction in air is 1

Trial # | @, (degrees) | 8, (degrees) | Sin, | Sin,

1 5.0 8.0 0.09 | 0.14
2 15 21 0.26 | 0.36
3 25 39 0.42 | 0.63

4 35 56 057 | 0.83
