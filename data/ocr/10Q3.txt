‘Three particles are fixed in place in a horizontal plane, as shown in the figure above. Particle 3 at the top of the
triangle has charge q, of +1.0 x 10° C,, and the electrostatic force F on it due to the charge on the two other
particles is measured to be entirely in the negative x-direction, The magnitude of the charge q, on particle 1 is

known to be 4.0 x 10°° C, and the magnitude of the charge g, on particle 2 is known to be 1.7 x 10°° C, but
their signs are not known.
