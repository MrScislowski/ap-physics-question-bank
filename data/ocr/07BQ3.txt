1000 Q

5000 = 30x 10%F

3. (15 points)
In the circuit above, a 12.0 V battery is connected to two resistors, one of resistance 1000 Q and the other of

resistance 500 Q.. A capacitor with a capacitance of 30 x 10~Â° F is connected in parallel with the 500.2
resistor. The circuit has been connected for a long time, and all currents have reached their steady states.
