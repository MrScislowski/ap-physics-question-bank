It is possible for an electron and a positron to orbit around their stationary center of mass until they annihilate
each other, creating two photons of equal energy moving in opposite directions. A positron is a particle that has
the same mass as an electron and equal but opposite charge. The amount of kinetic energy of the electron-
positron pair before annihilation is negligible compared to the energy of the photons created.
