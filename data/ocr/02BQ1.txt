(15 points)

A.2.0 kg frictionless cart is moving at a constant speed of 3.0 mV/s to the right on a horizontal surface, as shown
above, when it collides with a second cart of undetermined mass m that is initially at rest. The force F of the
collision as a function of time + is shown in the graph below, where t= 0 is the instant of initial contact. As a
result of the collision, the second cart acquires a speed of 1.6 m/s to the right. Assume that friction is negligible

before, during, and after the collision.
