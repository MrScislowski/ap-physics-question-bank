i, Draw an ammeter in the circuit above in a location such that it could measure the current in the 500 Q

resistor. Use the symbot @) to indicate the ammeter.

Draw a voltmeter in the circuit above in a location such that it could measure the voltage across the
1000 © resistor. Use the symbol © to indicate the voltmeter
