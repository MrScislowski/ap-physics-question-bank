4. (15 points)

A marine archaeologist looks out the port of a research submarine, as shown above. The port is spherically
shaped with center of curvature at point C and radius of curvature r. It is made of a material that has an index of
refraction of n,,, the same as the index of refraction of seawater, which is greater than 1,,, the index of
refraction of air. The archaeologist is located to the left of point C and some equipment in the submarine is
located behind the archaeologist. The archaeologist can see through the port, but the port also acts as a mirror so
the archaeologist can see the reflection of the equipment.
